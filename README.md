tic-tac-4
=========

Game project developed for the object oriented development course for Msc Software Engineering for Ambient Intelligence. The idea was to create Connect-4 and TicTacToe with simple programmable AI rules, with as much common code as possible between the two implementations. Command line and UI implementations available.

Game modes should include human vs human, human vs AI, and AI vs AI. The AI has four rules of play whose order can be changed making the AI change priorities when making decisions.\

The focus of the project is in software reuse, scalability, extendibility and architecture.

-- Expected Project-development time: 24 hours (including documentation)

Deliverable as eclipse project
