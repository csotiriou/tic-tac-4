tic-tac-4
=========

Game project developed for the object oriented development course for Msc Software Engineering for Ambient Intelligence. The idea was to create Connect-4 and TicTacToe with simple programmable AI rules, with as much common code as possible between the two implementations. Command line and UI implementations available.
